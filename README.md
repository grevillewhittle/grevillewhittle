- 👋 Hi, I’m @grevillewhittle
- 👀 I’m interested in tabletop rpgs, dabbling in programming languages, science fiction, and other geekery.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to make macros and modules for Foundry VTT (which uses JavaScript). Other languages I like are c/c++, objective-c, and swift.
